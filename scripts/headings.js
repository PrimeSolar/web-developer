/**
 * Document Headings Enumerator
 *
 * Collect all heading elements (h1–h6) from the current webpage, enumerate them,
 * log their tag names and trimmed text content.
 *
 * Behavior details:
 *
 * document.querySelectorAll("h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6") returns a static NodeList of heading elements in document order. Spreading into an array ensures array methods (like forEach) are available.
 * forEach iterates through the headings array with an index. Index is zero-based, so 1 is added to present a human-friendly ordinal in logs.
 * heading.tagName specifies the tag name in uppercase (for example, "H1"), clearly identifying the heading level in output.
 * heading.textContent includes all descendant text; trim() removes leading/trailing whitespace for cleaner output.
 * Console output format: ": - " is concise, line-by-line listing suitable for content auditing.
 * The final console.log confirms the script is successfully completed.
